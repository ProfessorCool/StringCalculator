# StringCalculator
This is a simple program meant to test my basic understanding of C++ principles, including classes, iostreams, and program logic. If you want to contribute, go ahead.
## Features
This program can perform one line of math, using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents. This program also supports the sqrt keyword to take square roots. As well, this program can take an input file and perform operations for every line on the input file, and output it to an output file.
## Warning
Make sure to include the executable in its own file directory, as it creates 3 additional files.
